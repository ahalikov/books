/**
 * Let's see what these fancy-shmancy streams are
 *
 * Compared to collections:
 *
 * 1. A stream does not store its elements. They may be stored in an underlying
 * collection or generated on demand
 *
 * 2. Stream operations donâ€™t mutate their source.
 * Instead, they return new streams that hold the result.
 *
 * 3. Stream operations are lazy when possible. This means they are not executed
 * until their result is needed. For example, if you only ask for the first five long
 * words instead of counting them all, then the filter method will stop filtering
 * after the fifth match. As a consequence, you can even have infinite streams!
 *
 * 4. They can be easily parallelized! (loops are not)
 *
 * When you work with streams, you set up a pipeline of operations in three stages:
 *
 * 1. You create a stream.
 *
 * 2. You specify intermediate operations for transforming the initial stream into
 * others, in one or more steps.
 *
 * 3. You apply a terminal operation to produce a result. This operation forces the
 * execution of the lazy operations that precede it. Afterwards, the stream can
 * no longer be used.
