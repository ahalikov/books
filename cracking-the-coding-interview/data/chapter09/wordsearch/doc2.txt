Schema Creation
Now that all of the connections have been created, we can create our schema.
When creating the schema, we can use the optional IF NOT EXISTS conditional,
which will allow running the command multiple times without error.
When this conditional is not specified, additional executions of the schema
creation code will result in a QueryExecutionException.
This conditional is available only in Cassandra 2.0 and later.
Listing 9.4 shows how to create a keyspace and a sample table.
