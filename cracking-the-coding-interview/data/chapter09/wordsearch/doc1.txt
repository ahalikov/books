Why Akka?

What features can the Akka platform offer, over the competition?

Akka provides scalable real-time transaction processing.

Akka is an unified runtime and programming model for:

Scale up (Concurrency)
Scale out (Remoting)
Fault tolerance
One thing to learn and admin, with high cohesion and coherent semantics.

Akka is a very scalable piece of software, not only in the context of performance
but also in the size of applications it is useful for.
The core of Akka, akka-actor, is very small and easily dropped into an existing
project where you need asynchronicity and lockless concurrency without hassle.

You can choose to include only the parts of akka you need in your application.
With CPUs growing more and more cores every cycle, Akka is the alternative that
provides outstanding performance even if you're only running it on one machine.
Akka also supplies a wide array of concurrency-paradigms, allowing users to choose
the right tool for the job.
