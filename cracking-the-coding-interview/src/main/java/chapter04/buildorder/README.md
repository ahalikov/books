You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies (which is a list of pairs of projects, 
where the first project is dependent on the second project). 

All of a projectâ€™s dependencies must be built before the project is. 
Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. 
If there is no valid build order, return an error.

Example:

  Input:
    Projects: a, b, c, d, e, f
    Dependencies: (d, a), (b, f), (d, b), (a, f), (c, d)

  Output: f, e, a, b, d, c

Design:
  
Project
  - name: String
  - dependencies: List<String>
  
  + Project(name)
  + addDependency(Project project)
  + getDependencies(): List<Project>

   
BuildGraph
  - projects: List<Project> 
  
  + BuildGraph()
  + BuildGraph(Project...projects)
  + addProject(Project project)
