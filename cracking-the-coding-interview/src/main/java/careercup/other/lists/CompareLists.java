/**
 * Compare two strings represented as linked lists
 *
 * Given two linked lists, represented as linked lists (every character
 * is a node in linked list). Write a function compare() that works similar to strcmp(),
 * i.e., it returns 0 if both strings are same, 1 if first linked list is lexicographically
 * greater, and -1 if second string is lexicographically greater.
 *
 * Input:
 *  list1 = g->e->e->k->s->a
 *  list2 = g->e->e->k->s->b
 *  Output: -1
 *
 * Input:
 *  list1 = g->e->e->k->s->a
 *  list2 = g->e->e->k->s
 *  Output: 1
 *
 * Input:
 *  list1 = g->e->e->k->s
 *  list2 = g->e->e->k->s
 *  Output: 0
